						<p class="light">For the past decade, Hyundai Development Company has maintained the highest profit margin in the industry based on strong financial structure, laying the foundation for sustainable growth. Today, the company is committed to realizing Vision 2016 by expanding its business area to green energy, plants and overseas resource development.</p>
						<p class="light">In particular, Hyundai Development Company has successfully implemented a number of projects including Samcheonpo thermal power plant units 1-6, Danyang small-hydro power plant and Icheon cogeneration plant. Based on the expertise in the plant business, the company looks to achieve leadership position in the domestic and overseas nuclear power plant business. At the same time, we will reinvent ourselves as a general contractor in a real sense armed with excellent engineering capacity, utilizing our ample experience in cement, desalination, and oil refining plants as well as desulphurization facilities for thermal power plants both at home and abroad.</p>
						<p class="light">After building a presence in the nuclear and other plant business, Hyundai Development Company plans to make forays into the ocean energy and small-hydro power plant business.</p>
						<p class="light">Furthermore, the company will take full advantage of its experience in urban development such as new city development, urban rehabilitation and urban redevelopment, utilizing networks of trading companies and engineering firms home and abroad and forming strategic partnerships with government-run agencies and overseas specialty contractors. In doing so, we will solidify our status as a Global Leading Developer & Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contractor.</p>
